  title  : Body Weight Gain Analysis Based on the BW Domain
  desc   : > 
           The FDA has recently required that nonclinical toxicology study 
           data from new studies be submitted electronically in CDISC-SEND 
           format.  One of the current limitations of the CDISC-SEND data 
           standard is that the BG domain, which encodes changes in animal 
           body weight gains, only allows analysis of changes in body weight 
           over a fixed time interval.  Through the PhUSE consortium, an open 
           source software solution to this problem has been collaboratively 
           developed by the pharmaceutical industry, software vendors, and 
           government regulators.  The R package, Shiny, facilitates the 
           development of user-friendly, web-based “Apps”, providing a platform 
           for the analysis and visualization of SEND datasets.  An R Shiny App 
           has been developed to allow end users with little-to-no programming 
           experience to evaluate changes in body weight gains from any SEND-encoded 
           toxicology study across a user-defined time interval.
